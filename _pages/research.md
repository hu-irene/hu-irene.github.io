 * __Man Overboard! Industrial Fishing as a Driver of Out-Migration in Africa__, with [François Libois](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/libois-francois)
 
The adoption of a capital intensive technology to extract natural resource, competing directly with a more traditional and labour intensive use, can trigger migration in developing countries. This article focuses on the effect of fish stock depletion on migration in Africa and uses a novel dataset on industrial fishing intensity (Kroodsma et al., 2018). Based on a panel of the 37 African countries with access to the sea over the period 2012-2018, we show that within country variation in industrial fishing intensity increases migration to OECD countries. We find strong evidence that the competition created by industrial fishing vessels overfishing African seas and depleting fish stocks, increase the number of migrants to OECD countries. We then show that findings at the macro level are consistent in terms of mechanisms with micro level estimates using household level demographic data.

 * __MiningLeaks: Water Pollution and Child Mortality in Africa__, with [Mélanie Gittard](https://sites.google.com/view/melaniegittard/home)
 
Industrial mining can be a boon or a bane for communities living in the vicinity of production sites. We assess the environmental and health impacts of industrial mining in Africa using micro-data from 1986 to 2018 in 26 countries matched with geocoded data of industrial mining sites. Through a staggered difference-in-difference strategy, we exploit the variation of the opening of a mine and the relative topographic position of surrounding villages. Relying on an upstream-downstream topographic treatment, we show that opening an industrial mining site increases infant mortality and that this effect is driven by mining-induced water pollution.

 * __Raw Materials Diplomacy, Official Development Finance and the Industrial Exploitation of Natural Resources in Africa__

This paper investigates how official development finance from traditional and emerging donors influences the industrial exploitation of natural resources in Africa. Willingly or not, loans contribute to the local influence a donor country can have in a recipient country, and its companies can benefit from easier access to extract the recipient's natural resources. Using development finance flows panel data from the OECD countries, China, India and the Gulf countries on the one side, and novel data on industrial extraction of natural resources on the other side. Through an extended descriptive analysis, I find that official development flows from DAC and non-DAC countries are positively correlated with their capacity to conclude large-scale land acquisitions in Africa, over 2000-2014.
