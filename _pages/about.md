Welcome to my personal website!


I am an __environmental economist__ at the OECD Environment Directorate (ENV), Environment and Economy Integration Division (EEI). I am interested in __natural resources, climate change adaptation, pollution, health and migration__.   

I completed my Ph.D. in 2023 at the __Paris School of Economics (PSE) and Université Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne__. I worked under the supervision of [Fabrice Etilé](https://sites.google.com/site/fabriceetile) (PSE/INRAE) and [François Libois](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/libois-francois) (PSE/INRAE). In my thesis, I study the __determinants and consequences of the industrial exploitation of natural resources in Africa__, at the micro and macro level. 

On another spectrum, I am also interested in __education policies__ and large-scale assessment and have worked on the analysis of the PISA 2022 results: [Volume II - Learning During – and From – Disruption]([https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/pisa-2022-results-volume-ii_a97db61c-en](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/pisa-2022-results-volume-ii_a97db61c-en.html)), the [country note for France](https://hu-irene.github.io/files/Countrynote_FRA_French.pdf) and a PISA in Focus note on [Managing screen time: How to protect and equip students against distraction](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/managing-screen-time_7c225af4-en.html).
