Welcome to my personal website!


I am an applied economist interested in environment, natural resources, migration and education. 

I completed my Ph.D. in March 2023 at the Paris School of Economics (PSE) and Université Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne. I worked under the supervision of [Fabrice Etilé](https://sites.google.com/site/fabriceetile) (PSE/INRAE) and [François Libois](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/libois-francois) (PSE/INRAE). In my thesis, I study the determinants and consequences of the industrial exploitation of natural resources in Africa, at the micro and macro level. 

On another spectrum, I am also interested in education policies and large-scale assessment and have joined the [PISA team](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/contacts/whoswhoinpisa.htm) at the OECD since January 2023 to work on the analysis of the results of the PISA 2022 surveys. 

__I am on the 2023/2024 Job Market.__ My Job Market Paper (../files/files/MiningLeaks_GITTARD_HU.pdf) shows that industrial mining increases by 25% the 2 year-old mortality rates in Africa through water pollution. 

__Research interests :__ Environmental Economics, Development Economics, Natural Resource Economics, Economics of Migration, Health Economics, Economics of Education.
