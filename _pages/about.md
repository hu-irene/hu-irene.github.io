Welcome to my personal website!


I am an __environmental economist__ working at the Environment and Economic Integration Division of the OECD Environment Directorate. I am interested in __natural resources, climate change adaptation, pollution, health and migration__.   

We have recently published the [OECD Environmental Outlook on the Triple Planetary Crisis](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/environmental-outlook-on-the-triple-planetary-crisis_257ffbb6-en.html) that examines in detail the interlocking trends and drivers of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, projects how they will evolve through mid-century, and examines policy synergies and trade-offs. It also provides a roadmap to help governments tackle these challenges in a more integrated manner. 

I completed my Ph.D. in 2023 at the __Paris School of Economics (PSE) and Université Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne__. I worked under the supervision of [Fabrice Etilé](https://sites.google.com/site/fabriceetile) (PSE/INRAE) and [François Libois](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/libois-francois) (PSE/INRAE). In my thesis, I studied the __determinants and consequences of the industrial exploitation of natural resources in Africa__, at the micro and macro level. 

On another spectrum, I am also interested in __education policies__ and large-scale assessment and have worked on the analysis of the PISA 2022 results: [Volume II - Learning During – and From – Disruption](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/pisa-2022-results-volume-ii_a97db61c-en.html), the [country note for France](https://hu-irene.github.io/files/Countrynote_FRA_French.pdf) and a PISA in Focus note on [Managing screen time: How to protect and equip students against distraction](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/managing-screen-time_7c225af4-en.html). 


__Research interests :__ Environmental Economics, Development Economics, Natural Resource Economics, Economics of Migration, Health Economics, Economics of Education.
